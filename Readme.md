and also in this directory see result.requests that contain link to main file 'requests_result.json'


you can see some graph and figure for used for viualization requests

all code and dataset need to running code find here . 


TimeExecuteOneRequest.ipynb : recurrent neural network code for forcasting number call of span in future time series 

create_dataset_from_traces : create dataset from json file of trace requests

graphForMultiRequests : create graph for multiple requests
